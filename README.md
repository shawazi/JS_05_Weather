i need to search the documentation and figure out how to specify the state/country of the specified location name. using a comma only removes everything after the comma from the API call. 

springfield returns springfield, illinois

springfield, massachusetts returns springfield, illinois

springfield, ajoisdfjoad returns springfield, illinois

springfield massachusetts (no comma) returns an error fetching the data from openweather

this occurs with many duplicate location names. not sure how to fix it. 

i need a more cohesive theme for the images that are in the cards. sometimes the text is clear, but sometimes it is barely legible due to the background image. 

i just wanted to implement the functionality, i will choose better images and hopefully find a unified theme for all the atmospheric background images.
