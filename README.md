need to adjust CSS styling of the newly created cards, as well as many other aesthetic features. 

I can add more data to the cards as well, but first i need to format that data properly, so that the cards are all a uniform size, and so that once the cards read the end of the viewport width, they wrap around to the next line (preserving card size)
